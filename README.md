## Overview
This code is written for the 2025 Crick BioImage Analsyis Symposium (CBIAS) as a method of data analysis for the poster **'Optimising quantitative methods to assess the efficacy of clearing protocols for light-sheet microscopy'**. In this code, our aim is to provide a quick, user-friendly pipeline to assess clearing efficacy of a 3-dimensional sample using simple statistical parameters, broadening scientific communication and easing access for those without computational expertise.




## Content
This repo contains 2 Jupyter Notebooks:

- `pixel_intensity_measurement.ipynb`: a Notebook which imports an image and measures the properties of the image to assess clearing efficacy, and saves this data to a `.csv` file.
- `combine_csv.ipynb`: a Notebook which combines several of these `.csv` files to combine data and visualise your data into a lineplot to compare/contrast, which can then be saved and used.

This repo will also have example data (`test_image.tif`), on which these notebooks can be used and tested for modifications.
